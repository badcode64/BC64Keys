## Why BC64Keys?

**Frustrated with Karabiner's complexity?** You're not alone.

I created BC64Keys because I just wanted to **remap a few keys** — not learn a new configuration language, edit JSON/XML files, or navigate through hundreds of options.

### BC64Keys vs Karabiner Elements

| Feature | BC64Keys | Karabiner Elements |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Configuration | Visual GUI, click & press | JSON config files |
| Learning curve | ⚡ Minutes | 📚 Hours/Days |
| Codebase size | ~2,100 lines | ~100,000+ lines |
| Code auditability | ✅ Easy to review | ❌ Very complex |
| Setup time | 30 seconds | 10-30 minutes |
| Universal Binary | ✅ Apple Silicon + Intel | ✅ Yes |
| Code Signing | ✅ Developer ID | ✅ Yes |
| Notarized | ✅ Apple Notarized | ✅ Yes |

### 🔒 Security First

**This app has access to your keystrokes** — that's how keyboard remapping works. 

This is why BC64Keys is:
- **100% Open Source** (GPL-3.0)
- **Single file design** (~2,100 lines) — anyone can audit it in minutes
- **No network access** — works completely offline
- **No data collection** — your keystrokes stay on your Mac
- **No external dependencies** — pure Swift/SwiftUI
- **Apple Notarized** — verified and signed by Apple's security team

> Unlike massive, complex tools where security vulnerabilities can hide in thousands of files, BC64Keys is simple enough that **you can read and verify the entire codebase yourself in under an hour**.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Release (Recommended) ⭐

**Latest version: v1.5.0** ([Download](https://github.com/badcode64/BC64Keys/releases/latest))

1. Download **BC64Keys-v1.5.0.dmg** from [Releases](https://github.com/badcode64/BC64Keys/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag **BC64Keys.app** to your Applications folder
4. Launch BC64Keys from Applications
5. Grant Accessibility permission when prompted

✅ **No right-click workarounds needed** — the app is signed and notarized by Apple!

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/badcode64/BC64Keys.git
cd BC64Keys

# Build and run
./build.sh
open BC64Keys.app
```

### Granting Accessibility Permission

BC64Keys needs Accessibility permission to remap keys:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
2. Click the **+** button
3. Add **BC64Keys** and enable it
4. Restart BC64Keys if needed

### Why Accessibility?

Keyboard remapping on macOS requires intercepting and modifying system-wide key events before they reach applications. This low-level access is protected by macOS's Accessibility permission system to prevent unauthorized keylogging or input manipulation. BC64Keys uses a `CGEventTap` to observe and transform keyboard events globally — this is the same mechanism used by system utilities like macOS's own keyboard shortcuts. Without this permission, the app cannot intercept keys and remapping won't work.

## Usage

### Remapping a Key

1. Go to the **Mapping** tab
2. Click **+ New Rule**
3. Click the **Source** box and press the key you want to remap
4. Choose the target:
   - **Key Swap**: Click target box and press replacement key
   - **Navigation**: Select a predefined macOS action
5. Click **Save**

### Monitoring Keys

Use the **Monitor** tab to see what keys you're pressing — useful for finding key codes and testing your mappings.

### Per-App Filtering

Want a mapping to work only in specific apps (or exclude certain apps)?

1. When creating/editing a rule, scroll to **App Filter**
2. Choose:
   - **All Apps** — Apply everywhere (default)
   - **Include** — Apply only in selected apps
   - **Exclude** — Apply everywhere except selected apps
3. Select apps from the running apps list

### Debug Logging

By default, BC64Keys doesn't write logs to save SSD wear. To enable:

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Enable **Debug Logging**
3. Logs will be written to `~/Library/Logs/BC64Keys/bc64keys-status.log`

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary><b>Is BC64Keys safe to use?</b></summary>

Yes! BC64Keys is:
- **100% open source** — you can review the entire codebase
- **Signed with Developer ID** — verified by Apple
- **Notarized by Apple** — passed Apple's security checks
- **No network access** — all processing is local
- **No data collection** — your keystrokes never leave your Mac

The entire codebase is ~2,100 lines and designed for easy security auditing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why does BC64Keys need Accessibility permission?</b></summary>

Keyboard remapping requires intercepting system-wide key events using macOS's `CGEventTap` API. This low-level access is protected by the Accessibility permission system to prevent unauthorized keylogging. BC64Keys uses the same mechanism as macOS's built-in keyboard shortcuts.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will my settings be preserved when I update?</b></summary>

Yes! All your key mappings and preferences are stored in macOS UserDefaults, not inside the app bundle. When you update BC64Keys, simply replace the old app with the new one — your settings will remain intact.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use BC64Keys alongside Karabiner Elements?</b></summary>

Not recommended. Both apps intercept keyboard events at the system level, which can cause conflicts. Choose one and disable the other.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does BC64Keys work on Apple Silicon Macs?</b></summary>

Yes! BC64Keys is a universal binary that runs natively on both Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel Macs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I uninstall BC64Keys?</b></summary>

1. Quit BC64Keys (Cmd+Q)
2. Disable "Launch at Login" in Settings (optional, but recommended)
3. Move BC64Keys.app from Applications to Trash
4. Remove Accessibility permission: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → Remove BC64Keys

Your settings will remain in UserDefaults. To completely remove everything:
```bash
defaults delete com.bc64.BC64Keys
```
